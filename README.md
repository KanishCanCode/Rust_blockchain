# Rust_blockchain


This implementation includes:

1. `Block` struct: represents a single block in the blockchain.
2. `Blockchain` struct: manages the chain of blocks and pending transactions.
3. `add_block` method: creates a new block and adds it to the chain.
4. `calculate_hash` method: calculates the hash for a block.
5. `add_transaction` method: adds a transaction to the pending transactions.
6. `mine_block` method: creates a new block from pending transactions.

Run the code using `cargo run` to see the blockchain in action!

Keep in mind that this is a highly simplified example. Real-world blockchains require additional features like:

- Consensus algorithms (e.g., Proof of Work, Proof of Stake)
- Network communication
- Cryptographic signatures
- Transaction validation
- Security measures

*Note:* This is a basic example for educational purposes only. Real-world blockchains require additional features, security measures, and testing.
